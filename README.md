MAVLink Encoding and Decoding in Go

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/daedaleanai/gomavlink?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/daedaleanai/gomavlink)

The top level package defines an Encoder and Decoder type that can handle the dialects generated from the XML files in the subpackages.

The dialect subpackages are entirely auto-generated by the included mavgen tool.
