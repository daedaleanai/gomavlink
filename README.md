MAVLink Encoding and Decoding in Go (and C)

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/daedaleanai/gomavlink?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/daedaleanai/gomavlink)

MAVLink is documented on https://mavlink.io/en/

The top level package defines Encoder and Decoder types that can handle the dialects generated from the XML files in the subpackages.

The dialect subpackages are entirely auto-generated by the included mavgen tool.

usable for dumping ardupilot tlogs, see tlog/dump.go

NOTE ON THE LICENSE: 
The generator code ./mavgen and the .tmpl files are under the MIT license in the root directory.
You can always run ./mavgen on whatever XML you feel running it on and use the output however you see fit, but 
The generated files here are derived from XML code under the LGPL, i include them here as a service, but they are under the LGPL, i think.


NEW: the C directory contains templates to generate C code, a completely independent implementation with no dependencies to serialize and 
deserialize mavlink messages.  See the C/README.md

WIP! a little patience please.
TODO:
- imprint git version of xml files used to generate
- V2 signatures
- nice api for commands/parameters
- decent test suite
- test V2 decoding/encoding
- test V1 encoding
- String() method for generated message types that prints [n]byte as string 
- figure out if we can decide between V1 and V2 purely on message id.  i.e. are mid<255 always sent as V1 with no signature?  if so, we could only generate V1 or V2 encode/decode based on message id. but then why have extended fields if you dont have a way to send messages as v1?
